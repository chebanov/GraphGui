# GraphGui
This is my CS313 class project.
It's implementation of a GUI to find the shortest path and minimal spanning tree on a graph using Dijkstra's algotrithm. 
You can find description of the project in GraphGuiProject.pdf.
When you run GGProject.java, you can also read Help to understand how to use this program.
